/* On your phone keypad, the alphabets are mapped to digits as follows: 
 * ABC(2), DEF(3), GHI(4), JKL(5), MNO(6), PQRS(7), TUV(8), WXYZ(9).
Write a program called PhoneKeyPad, which prompts user for a String (case insensitive),
and converts to a sequence of Keypad digits. Use a nested-if (or switch-case) in this
exercise. Modify your program to use an array for table look-up later.
Hints: You can use in.next().toLowerCase() to read a string and convert it to lowercase 
to reduce your cases. */
